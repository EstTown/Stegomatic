# Stegomatic
Steganography-software designed to hide text messages in images.
This software uses a graphtheory-based approach to steganography, which heightens the security of the hidden message, as opposed to other embedding methods, such as LSB.


The software is written in C#6 (.NET 4.6.2) using Visual Studio 2015, implemented with a Winforms-based GUI.
